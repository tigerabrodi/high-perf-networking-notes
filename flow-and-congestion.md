Yes, congestion control and flow control are related but serve different purposes in TCP:

## Flow Control vs. Congestion Control

### Flow Control

- **Primary purpose**: Prevents overwhelming the receiver
- **Controlled by**: The receiver
- **Mechanism**: Receive window (rwnd)
- **Concerns**: End-to-end buffer capacity
- **Question it answers**: "How much data can the receiver handle?"

### Congestion Control

- **Primary purpose**: Prevents overwhelming the network
- **Controlled by**: The sender
- **Mechanism**: Congestion window (cwnd)
- **Concerns**: Network path capacity and congestion
- **Question it answers**: "How much data can the network handle?"

## How They Work Together

The actual sending rate in TCP is governed by the minimum of these two windows:

```
Effective Window = min(cwnd, rwnd)
```

This means a sender will never send:

1. More than the receiver can handle (flow control)
2. More than the network can handle (congestion control)

## Why Both Are Needed

Consider these scenarios:

1. **Fast sender, slow receiver**: Without flow control, the receiver's buffers would overflow, causing packet loss even if the network is fine.

2. **Both fast, but congested network**: Without congestion control, packets would be dropped in the network even if the receiver has plenty of buffer space.

The relationship between these mechanisms helps TCP adapt to both endpoint limitations and network conditions, making it remarkably versatile across different network environments.
