my notes on chapter 2:

tcp and ip, what they both are and do

how tcp is reliable but timely, and all the nuances/concerns it handls for u

the author explains the three way handshake iun detail and what the client and server does, how the client starts by picking a random sequence number x and sends syn, which may also include additionsl tcp galgs and optiosn

sync ack

and akc

both are also explained

tcp connections are expensive tro create, its why connection reuse is critical, also because each new connection will have a full roundtrip

apparently TFO, TCP fasto pen exists but has its own limitations?

congestion control seems to be a serious problem, lets dive into what this really means also
